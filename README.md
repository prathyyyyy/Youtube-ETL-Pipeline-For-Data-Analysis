## 1.Tech Stack
Languages: SQL, Python 3
Services: AWS S3, AWS Glue, QuickSight, AWS Lambda, AWS Athena, AWS IAM
## 2.Key Concepts
### Data Pipeline
A data pipeline is established to transfer raw data from various sources to destinations. It includes processes such as data collection, storage, analytics, and transformation to prepare data for querying.

### Amazon S3
Amazon S3 provides highly scalable and durable object storage for various data types. It offers high availability, scalability, and cost-effective storage options.

### AWS IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management enables secure management of access and permissions to AWS resources. It allows defining fine-grained access controls to ensure security and compliance within the AWS infrastructure.

### AWS QuickSight
Amazon QuickSight is a serverless business intelligence service that offers scalable analytics capabilities. It connects to various data sources and provides cost-effective BI solutions.

### AWS Glue
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that simplifies data preparation and integration tasks. It supports running Spark/Python code without managing infrastructure, making it cost-effective and efficient.

### AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that executes code without managing servers. It automates infrastructure management, scaling, monitoring, and logging, making it ideal for running data processing tasks.

### AWS Athena

AWS Athena is a serverless query service for analyzing data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL queries. It offers on-demand scalability and cost-effectiveness for ad-hoc data analysis tasks.

## 3.Usage
1. Data Collection: Upload the YouTube dataset to AWS S3.
2. Data Processing: Utilize AWS Glue for data preparation and transformation.
3. Querying Data: Use AWS Athena to analyze the transformed data with SQL queries.
4. Visualization: Visualize insights using QuickSight dashboards.
5. Automation: Implement automation using AWS Lambda for scheduled or event-triggered tasks.
